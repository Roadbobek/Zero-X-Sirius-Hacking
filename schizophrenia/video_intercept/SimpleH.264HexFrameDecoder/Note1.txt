VIDEO STREAM FRAGMENTATION ANALYSIS FINDINGS
Current Findings in the Network Data (SOLVED)
We have successfully identified the key markers used for reassembling the video fragments into complete H.264 frames.

--------------------------------
Data Component
Location (0-Based Byte)
Size
Purpose
--------------------------------
Frame ID -----------------------
Byte 8 and Byte 9 (e.g., B8 85)
2 Bytes
Unites all fragments belonging to the same single picture.
Fragment Index -----------------
Byte 32
1 Byte
Specifies the correct sequential order of the fragments (00, 01, 02, 03...) within a single Frame ID, allowing for full frame reassembly.

What We Need Next (The Missing Configuration)
The next major step is to locate the H.264 Header NAL Units (SPS and PPS).
These packets contain the video's essential configuration data (like the resolution, color space, and compression settings). Without them, a video player cannot initialize the decoder, even if the raw frame data is reassembled correctly.

Action Required: The next step for the automated script is to use the confirmed Fragment Index (Byte 32, 1 Byte long) to reassemble the complete stream, and then search the resulting data stream for the SPS/PPS header signatures.
